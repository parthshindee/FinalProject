        Through this study, we saw that biological sex significantly impacts
        various health measurements, and that data from different subjects can
        be highly variable. One key factor in these differences for mice is the
        estrus cycle, which introduces hormonal fluctuations that can affect
        physiology and behavior in females.
      </p>

      <p>
        Historically, many biological studies have focused primarily on male
        subjects to avoid this variability; this rationale leads to gaps in our
        understanding of female biology and how different drugs, diseases, and
        disorders present in females.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have found that the impact of estrus on temperature and activity
        resembles an anticipatable cycle as opposed to random variation in the
        data. These natural trends we see are crucial to study, and the
        regularity of these cycles allows for easy and accurate modeling.
        Including data from a variety of sources, including across sexes, is
        vitally important in health studies. Mice are common model organisms for
        biological research, and these experiments are often used as precursors
        to human health studies, so diversity in this aspect is important for
        understanding everyone's biology instead of just a subset of the
        population.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, including female subjects in research is crucial for
        developing a comprehensive understanding of biology and effective
        medical treatments. Additionally, it allows for a more accurate
        representation of biological diversity, ensuring that health information
        and interventions are equitable across sexes.
