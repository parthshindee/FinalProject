        <h2>Day 1: Establishing Sex Differences</h2>
        <p>
          We begin our 14-day observation comparing male (blue) and female (red) mice. Notice that female mice consistently maintain higher body temperatures throughout the day, typically 0.2-0.3°C warmer than males. Both sexes show peak activity during the dark phase, though females demonstrate slightly higher activity levels at the upper ranges.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="1">
        <h2>Day 2: Consistent Sex-Based Patterns</h2>
        <p>
          The sex-based differences remain stable on Day 2. Female mice continue to run warmer than males across all time points. The activity patterns are remarkably consistent with Day 1, establishing our baseline for detecting hormonal influences in the coming days.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="2">
        <h2>Day 3: Baseline Established</h2>
        <p>
          By Day 3, the consistent temperature differential between sexes is clear. Female body temperature remains elevated compared to males, particularly during peak activity hours. These three days of baseline data will help us identify estrus-related changes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="3">
        <h2>Day 4: Pre-Estrus Stability</h2>
        <p>
          Day 4 shows continued stable patterns. The temperature gap between males and females persists, with females maintaining their characteristic elevation. Activity distributions remain consistent, with females showing that slight edge at higher activity levels.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="4">
        <h2>Day 5: Approaching First Estrus</h2>
        <p>
          On Day 5, subtle changes begin to emerge in the female data. While the overall temperature remains elevated compared to males, we start to see slightly increased variability in female temperature patterns, suggesting approaching hormonal changes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="5">
        <h2>Day 6: First Estrus Peak</h2>
        <p>
          Day 6 marks the first estrus phase. Female body temperature shows a notable rise, creating an even larger gap compared to male temperatures. The elevation is most pronounced during the dark phase, where female temperatures can exceed male temperatures by up to 0.5°C. Activity levels also show increased intensity in females.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="6">
        <h2>Day 7: Post-Estrus Recovery</h2>
        <p>
          Following the estrus peak, Day 7 shows females gradually returning toward their baseline temperature elevation. However, they still maintain higher temperatures than males. The activity patterns begin to normalize, though females continue to show that characteristic higher range activity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="7">
        <h2>Day 8: Inter-Estrus Period</h2>
        <p>
          Day 8 represents the inter-estrus period. Female temperatures remain consistently higher than males but have stabilized from the Day 6 peak. This pattern demonstrates the cyclic nature of the estrus effect overlaid on the baseline sex difference.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="8">
        <h2>Day 9: Preparing for Next Cycle</h2>
        <p>
          On Day 9, we observe stable patterns with females maintaining their typical temperature elevation over males. The system appears to be preparing for the next estrus phase, with subtle increases in temperature variability appearing in the female data.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="9">
        <h2>Day 10: Second Estrus Peak</h2>
        <p>
          Day 10 brings the second estrus phase. Once again, female body temperatures rise significantly above their already-elevated baseline, creating a pronounced difference from male temperatures. The activity distribution also shows increased female activity at the high end, demonstrating the behavioral component of estrus.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="10">
        <h2>Day 11: Gradual Decline</h2>
        <p>
          Following the second estrus peak, Day 11 shows a gradual decline in female temperatures, though they remain substantially higher than male temperatures. The activity patterns also begin to normalize, returning toward the baseline sex-based differences.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="11">
        <h2>Day 12: Stable Inter-Estrus</h2>
        <p>
          Day 12 represents another stable inter-estrus period. The consistent temperature differential between sexes is maintained, with females running warmer throughout the circadian cycle. Activity patterns show the typical slight female advantage at higher ranges.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="12">
        <h2>Day 13: Pre-Estrus Indicators</h2>
        <p>
          As we approach the final estrus phase of our observation period, Day 13 shows subtle pre-estrus indicators. Female temperature variability begins to increase, and the baseline temperature elevation becomes more pronounced, particularly during peak activity hours.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="13">
        <h2>Day 14: Third Estrus Peak</h2>
        <p>
          Day 14 concludes our observation with the third estrus phase. Female temperatures once again surge above their baseline, creating the largest temperature differential from males. This regular 4-day cycle demonstrates how estrus effects compound with baseline sex differences, resulting in significant physiological variations that must be considered in biomedical research.
