        <h2>Day 1: Establishing Baseline</h2>
        <p>
          We begin with the first day of observation. Notice how female mice's activity peaks during 
          the dark phase, while core temperature follows a parallel—but slightly offset—rhythm. 
          This baseline is crucial for comparing later when estrus effects emerge.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="1">
        <h2>Day 2: Pattern Consistency</h2>
        <p>
          On Day 2, the circadian rhythms remain remarkably stable. Activity and temperature 
          curves overlay nearly identically onto yesterday's. The mouse's internal clock has 
          “locked in” its daily rhythm, giving us a strong reference point.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="2">
        <h2>Day 3: Reinforced Rhythms</h2>
        <p>
          By Day 3, the female mouse's circadian signature is well-established. Minor hour-to-hour 
          fluctuations are normal, but overall the curves maintain a consistent shape. These 
          three days of baseline data form the foundation for spotting any estrus-related shifts.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="3">
        <h2>Day 4: Early Estrus Signals</h2>
        <p>
          On Day 4, subtle deviations appear. Activity peaks grow slightly higher, and core 
          temperature shows an extra bump in the early evening. These early signals indicate 
          that hormonal changes are beginning to influence daily physiology.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="4">
        <h2>Day 5: Peak Estrus</h2>
        <p>
          Day 5 marks the peak of estrus-driven modulation. Activity levels can jump well above 
          baseline during the dark phase, and temperature fluctuations become more pronounced. 
          This dramatic shift demonstrates how the estrus cycle can strongly modulate both 
          behavior and physiology.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="5">
        <h2>Day 6: Estrus Continues</h2>
        <p>
          The effects persist on Day 6, though usually begin to taper from the Day 5 peak. Elevated 
          activity and more variable temperature curves remain. By tracking this entire period, 
          we see the full duration of estrus effects on daily rhythms.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="6">
        <h2>Day 7: Recovery Phase</h2>
        <p>
          As Day 7 arrives, patterns gradually return toward baseline. Activity and temperature are still 
          slightly elevated relative to Days 1-3, but the biggest spikes have subsided. This 
          “recovery” highlights the resilience of the circadian system: it takes time for daily 
          rhythms to stabilize after hormonal surges.
