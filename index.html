          Even small variations in physiology can reveal important insights. In many past studies,
          researchers have excluded female animals to avoid fluctuations caused by the estrus cycle,
          thereby missing half of the biological picture. By looking at both sexes, we can uncover
          how hormonal rhythms shape temperature and movement patterns.

          In this project, body temperatures and locomotor activity of male and
          female mice we recorded every minute over two full weeks. All animals were kept on a 12-hour light/
          12-hour dark schedule to synchronize their internal clocks. Over that 14-day window, we
          can capture thousands of data points from each animalâ€”allowing us to compare baseline sex
          differences and to see how female estrus cycles overlay on top of the daily rhythm.

          Let's dive deeper into the data to uncover any patterns!
