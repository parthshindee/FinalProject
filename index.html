      <h2>1. What have you done so far?</h2>
      <p>I've set up a GitHub Pages-hosted prototype that displays my first interactive visualization: the mean 24-hour activity profiles of female and male mice under a 12 h light/dark cycle. I loaded the raw Excel sheets, cleaned and merged the minute-by-minute activity and temperature data in JavaScript, and manipulated it into a single JSON format for Chart.js. Users can toggle each curve on or off via checkboxes, giving immediate feedback on sex-specific rhythm differences. The public repository (<code>your-username/estrus-predictor</code>) now contains all HTML, CSS and JS files, and I've confirmed the page renders correctly across desktop and mobile.  
      </p>
      <p>Overall, this prototype establishes the core UI structure—header, controls, canvas, and write-up sections—and proves my data pipeline from raw sheets to chart. Next steps will embed my preprocessing outputs directly into the visualization and begin annotating known estrus deviations.</p>

      <h2>2. What will be the most challenging part to design and why?</h2>
      <p>The biggest design challenge will be crafting a compelling “hook” and storytelling flow that follows an and-but-therefore structure, so viewers understand why estrus onset matters—and are surprised by what the data reveal. Embedding a project video on the page and linking it clearly will take careful layout work to avoid clutter while still being prominent. I also need to choose visual encodings that satisfy expressiveness criteria (for example, shading dark/light periods and annotating estrus windows) and ensure interactions let users filter, hover for details, and see model confidence—without overwhelming them.</p>
      <p>Finally, polishing the interactive elements to be bug-free and accessible (keyboard navigation, responsive resizing) is nontrivial. I will need to implement annotations, clear takeaways at the end, and ensure the entire page—visuals, story, and video—is cohesive, engaging, and meets the rubric's “Excellent” criteria for hook, storytelling, encodings, interaction, annotations, and takeaways.</p>
